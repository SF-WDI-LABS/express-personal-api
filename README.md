Welcome to the 'My Bird API'. You can use it to create and maintain your bird informations like:
* bird name
* bird type
* comments you want to add about the bird
* two images you can add for each bird
* a url link to learn more about this particular bird

## Technologies Used
* bootstrap for styling the HTML page
* ajax to send asynchronous HTTP request to server
* express and body-parser to provide the access to the server services
* Mongo DB and mongoose are used for noSQL DB

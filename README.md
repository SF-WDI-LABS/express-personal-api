Hello,

This is mini API I created for one of General Assembly's project.

My based URL for the api website is https://tranquil-springs-25959.herokuapp.com

These are the following end points you can add on to the based URL.

endpoints: [
  {method: "GET", path: "/", description: "Main index HTML page"},
  {method: "GET", path: "/api", description: "Describes all available endpoints"},
  {method: "GET", path: "/api/profile", description: "Data about me"}, 
  {method: "GET", path: "/api/images", description: "Open source image data I found interesting online"}, 
  {method: "GET", path: "/api/videos", description: "Open source video data I found interesting online"},
